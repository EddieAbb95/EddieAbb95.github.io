<h2 id="connecting-the-pieces">Connecting the Pieces</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&hellip;</p>

<p>To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&rsquo;ll only be used temporarily. In this case I bought a Harbor Freight furniture dolley to support the motor / transmission. The sticker claimed it could support 1000lbs and while the wood felt cheap the cashier assured me they&rsquo;re tougher than they appear.</p>

<p>For the price they aren&rsquo;t bad, but sadly the dolly snapped today. Thankfully it wasn&rsquo;t a clean break and I was able to slip something underneath before the motor hit the ground.</p>

<p>Up here in Maine the roads have salt on them for almost 6 months out of the year. While this car doesn&rsquo;t see much snow, I didn&rsquo;t want the bare welds to start rusting so I spent some time on them today. Here&rsquo;s the passenger wheel well before starting.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/2.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>To make working in there easier I pulled out the strut /  spindle quickly. Then hit the welds with a wire wheel.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/3.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>After that the welds were hit with some paint followed by rubberized undercoating. I meant to take a picture before moving on to the next step but I forgot. With the welds done I started running the new brake line for the passenger front caliper.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/4.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>You may notive a second hole in the above picture. Let&rsquo;s just say the first location caused the line to rub with the wheel and that was far from ideal&hellip;</p>

<p>I also managed to get the two fittings that weren&rsquo;t hooking up properly to finally mate with their lines. I purposely placed these under the heater core hoses to hide them from view.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/6.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>With those lines taken care of I was able to pop the heater core back in. I made sure every bolt / nut was holding it in place in hopes of reducing interior rattles.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/7.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Then I hooked up the heater core hoses + the new heater valve. The original valve never worked quite right after sand blasting it so I ended up splurging on a new oem one.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-15-18/8.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Figured it was time to finalize the fuel lines. The lines used were from a kit JB Tuned sells but honestly you should just cut out the main in the middle and buy directly from e85 Freaks. JB Tuned doesn&rsquo;t seem like that great of a company.</p>

<p>Cleaned up some of the wiring on the inside. Everything still visible will be hidden in the glove box.

<p>I tried bending my lines for the master cylinder. They aren&rsquo;t perfect but I&rsquo;m still pretty new to bending my own brake lines so I&rsquo;m pretty happy with them.</p>
