<h2 id="getting-closer">Getting Closer.</h2>

<p>I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.</p>

<p>Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/1.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Popped into position.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/2.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Then I lowered the motor down off the stand using the chain hoist in the garage. (I don&rsquo;t have an engine hoist to use.)
<img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/3.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>After that I bolted up the flywheel. I decided to go with a 12lb Competition Clutch flywheel and ARP bolts. Last year I ran an 8lb flywheel on my D15 Mini Me and didn&rsquo;t really care for it. Thanks to the engine&rsquo;s staggering 100ish ft-lbs of torque it took quite a bit of feathering the clutch to get moving.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/4.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Mated up the new clutch. It&rsquo;s nothing more than your standard Exedy OE replacement.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/5.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>5 monthes later the transmission and engine are finally mated!</p>

<p>Cleaned up the speed sensor.

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/9.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Halfshaft bolted up. I didn&rsquo;t restore it yet since I may need to get a new bearing for it.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/10.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Mock fitting the new battery terminals. The actual battery is in the bumper, so it&rsquo;s nice being able to jump it without popping the bumper off.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/11.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>After a butt load of sanding later.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/12.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Then a few coats of primer later.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/13.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Done! I went with rattle can since the body work isn&rsquo;t perfect and I figure someday down the road I&rsquo;ll be back fixing things up.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/14.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>To mate the B20 up to my exhaust I bought a Speed Daddy (read cheap Ebay brand) header. I&rsquo;ve had okay results with them in the past and figured they&rsquo;d be the same this time around. Turns out the header wouldn&rsquo;t even mate up to the head properly. Two of the tabs had to be trimmed and the gasket they provided needed to be cut up before things mated nicely.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/15.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Finally got the motor in, only to learn you need a special bracket for the driver side mount when swapping a B20 into an EG ugh.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/16.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>To keep making progress since I couldn&rsquo;t finish hooking up the motor I decided to start the brake lines. I&rsquo;m keeping the heater and SRS computer so there isn&rsquo;t much room to tuck the brakes in.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/19.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>This was my first time making my own brake lines. After a few trial runs I was feeling pretty confident and managed to bend a fairly complex line. Flaired both ends only to realize I pulled this little stunt off. Had to junk the line at that point.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/20.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Current status of the lines. All that&rsquo;s left is to run the 2 that go to the front calipers.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/23.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Close up.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/24.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the bay currently looks.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-14-18/18.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got the proper mount on order, and I&rsquo;ll pick up 2 new bulk head connectors for the brakes since they stripped out. I&rsquo;m hoping for a first start next weekend (fingers crossed).</p>
