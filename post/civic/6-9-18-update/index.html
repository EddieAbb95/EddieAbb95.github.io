<p>While the car may not be on the road yet, it&rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&rsquo;ve been working on
fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin.
Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap. I ended up buying just a generic pin for the clutch master
cylinder to hook it to the clutch pedal. Interestingly enough the metal was fairly soft as the pedal has worn a fairly noticable
grove into the pin itself.</p>

<p>I finally managed to run that last brake line. Ended up needing to order a 90 degree bulk head connector but I&rsquo;m pretty happy to be done
running brake lines.</p>

<p>Also finally trimmed the fan shroud. Turns out I bought the only header style that doesn&rsquo;t fit with an OEM fan. Oh well I like the extra clearance
it offers over the ebay header I had previously.</p>

<p>I like how you can see the brake lines + proportional valve.</p>

<p>With the custom battery location I needed a way to tie down the battery. Ended up bending a threaded rod to hold it down. I drilled
a hole through the bracket the battery is sitting on to ensure it can&rsquo;t slide forward or backwards during driving.</p>

<p>Battery nice and secured.</p>

<p>So close to having the car done. Pretty happy with how it&rsquo;s looking.</p>
