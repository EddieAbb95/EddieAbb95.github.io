<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.</p>

<p>Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead. I did however finally get the transmission bracket off the frame rail.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/1.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>I started off by sandblasting the rear transmission mount bracket. I had already started this about 3 monthes back so it only took a few minutes to finish up.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/2.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Then after painting it:</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/12.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>I also restored the throttle body. This is off a B18B1 and it was initially pretty gross. Here&rsquo;s before I did anything.</p>

<p>After sandblasting all the junk off it.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/4.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Painted up. I also bought 3 new bolts to attach the FITV to it.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/5.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like how rusty the throttle body studs were so I ended up removing them. I used the classic two nut trick to break them free.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/6.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Reinstalled the throttle body. I splurged on most of the bolts and went with a nice hex cap style.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/10a.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Some of the new bolts.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/9.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Then some goodies came in the mail. Since I&rsquo;m shaving the engine bay I decided to go with a nice inline fuel filter to get rid of the ugly stock one.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/13.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/14.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>The kit came with a nice return line, but since I&rsquo;m using a stock FPR it wasn&rsquo;t possible to use it. Instead I decided to spruce up the vacuum line connecting the valve cover port (forget the name) to the intake.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/civic/4-6-18/15.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>The engine is 100% done and ready to go. By the end of the coming week I&rsquo;ll have the transmission painted and ready to mate with the engine. Who knows how long the shell will take though.</p>
