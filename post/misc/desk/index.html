<h2 id="my-budget-build">My Budget Build</h2>

<p>At my work, I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&rsquo;s left me pretty happy.</p>

<p>I started off with a 18&rdquo;x48&rdquo; shelf from Lowes that I cut the top half of the bars off. I already knew the exact height I wanted thanks to my desk at work and proceeded to trim the shelf bars down to 44&rdquo;. I also found a nice piece of wood at Lowes that was a perfect size of 24&rdquo;x48&rdquo;, exactly what was my previous desk was. Here&rsquo;s the mock up:</p>

<p>Then after some sanding, staining, and finishing I came up with this:</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/desk/2.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>It was my first time staining, and it could use some work but overall I&rsquo;m happy with it. Everything fit pretty nicely once I moved it into it&rsquo;s new location.</p>

<p>I figured since I wouldn&rsquo;t want to stand <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> I would get a bar stool for when I needed a break. A quick trip to Walmart and I found an okay stool for 20 bucks. I ended up sanding it down to prep for staining and added some extra screws since it felt a little wobbly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I guess I didn&rsquo;t remove all of the original stain, so my new coat didn&rsquo;t take. It did produce a nice almost aged look so in the end it wasn&rsquo;t a total loss. It just doesn&rsquo;t quite match the desk top like I was hoping for.</p>

<p>Final set up. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a week now and am pretty happy with the results. I don&rsquo;t regret switching to a standing desk as it feels a lot better than sitting all the time.</p>
