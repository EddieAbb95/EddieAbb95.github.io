      <description>In the past ~12 months there&#39;s only been a couple weeks where I didn&#39;t have some kind of side project in the works. I&#39;m just a very hands on person who loves working on projects and code feels like the perfect medium. Best of all it&#39;s almost free to produce and when you mess up you&#39;re not out a lot of money vs other hobbies like woodworking.
But code has been more than a hobby for me.</description>

      <title>Unity - LiteNetLib&#39;s Delivery Methods</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/unity/litenetlib-delivery-methods/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/unity/litenetlib-delivery-methods/</guid>
      <description>While LiteNetLib may run on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which is an unreliable network protocol, LiteNetLib offers multiple delivery methods, some of which even offer &amp;ldquo;reliability&amp;rdquo;. Reliability is in quotes because when latency is high the chance of a packet being dropped is greater than 0 (although still fairly rare).
In total, LiteNetLib offers 5 different delivery methods for sending packets to peers. They are as follows:
 Unreliable ReliableUnOrdered Sequenced ReliableOrdered ReliableSequenced  Unreliable Unreliable is standard UDP.</description>

      <title>Unity - How to Send Data With LiteNetLib</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/unity/litenetlib-sending-data/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/unity/litenetlib-sending-data/</guid>
      <description>Continuing off the previous post about how to build a basic server / client set up with LiteNetLib it&#39;s time to talk about sending data. Because, well, a network set up that doesn&#39;t actually send any data is kind of useless.
As we already know, we listen for incoming messages from the network via an IEventListener that we pass to our NetManager. IEventListener contains an event called NetworkReceiveEvent which is triggered anytime the network receives data from another connection.</description>

      <description>LiteNetLib already provides a good example for creating a basic server / client set up in their documents, but if we want to use it with Unity there&#39;s a few extra steps we&#39;ll need to take. This article intends to cover the missing steps, and assume you already have LiteNetLib added to your Unity project.

      <description>TL;DR Download the most recent stable release source code zip and copy the /LiteNetLib folder to the Plugins folder in your Unity project.
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  LiteNetLib is an UDP networking library that can be used for building multiplayer games with Unity. If you have any experience working with Lidgren you&#39;ll feel right at home with LiteNetLib. LiteNetLib is not Unity specific, but it&#39;s a popular choice.

      <title>ASP.NET Core - Claims Based Authentication: Claims vs Identities vs Principals</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/aspnet/claims-based-authentication-claims-identities-principals/</link>

      <description>With the rise of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET 4.x, the built in authentication has undergone a shift from role-based access control (RBAC) to claim-based access control (CBAC). The most notable change is the User property on HttpContext is now of type ClaimsPrincipal instead of IPrincipal. Before we get to far ahead of ourselves though, lets start with the basics and build our way up.
Claims Claims are the foundation behind claims-based authentication (who would have guessed).</description>

      <description>ASP.NET Core supports dependency injection directly out of the box. For Web APIs this is useful for automatically resolving dependencies needed by controllers, or if you&#39;re a fan of Uncle Bob&#39;s Clean Architecture it can be used to inject external dependencies such as the database into the inner layers.
Let&#39;s imagine we&#39;re building an API that has a UserController to provide an endpoint for retrieving users via their numeric id from the database.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the second part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&#39;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Windows for as long as I can remember. Back when Windows 2000 was a big deal I remember using it to play Space Cadet pinball although I was never very good at it.
With the rise of Windows 10 it feels as if Microsoft is going downhill and no longer gives you &amp;ldquo;full control&amp;rdquo; of your own computer. My biggest gripe with Windows 10 is the automatic updates that it forces upon you.</description>

      <description>Mo&amp;rsquo; RAM, Mo&amp;rsquo; Problems I use my laptop for a ton of software development. I&#39;ve been working on launching a SaaS and I often need to have a development build of the backend running along with the frontend. Both of those and a database and I&#39;m easily eating up 5-6 gigabytes of RAM. My laptop is a Dell Inspirion 7559, and it came with 8 gigs of RAM from the factory.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&#39;t anything major and wasn&#39;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.
The Jeep had other plans though as the leak grew in size, and became extremely obnoxious. Due to the internals of the muffler rusting and coming loose, the muffler developed a horrendous rattle that sounded like a trumpet blasting a low note when at 2300RPM.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - Interpolated Strings</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/interpolated-strings/</guid>
      <description>Coming from the .NET world String.Format() was by far my most used function for generating user readable error / log messages. After jumping over to TypeScript, I was bummed to learn that no similar function existed. However, it wasn&#39;t so bad, after all console.log() allows us to pass multiple parameters and has no trouble logging them.
let foo = { bar: 1 };console.log(&amp;#34;Foo is &amp;#34;, foo);//Prints: Foo is Object { bar : 1 }But this only covers one of the many use cases I used String.</description>

      <title>HTTP Status Codes For a RESTful API</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/http/status-codes-for-rest/</guid>
      <description>Intro Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) powers the web. It&#39;s the silent work horse used to carry data between servers and clients, and is the reason why all URLs start with HTTP, or HTTPS. For those new to HTTP, it can be though of as clients (users) making requests that are sent to servers which then reply back with responses. Only servers can make responses, and only clients can make requests.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve honestly been very lucky with my Jeep. My previous daily driver was a 2009 Subaru Legacy, and while it may have been excellent in the snow it had a very high cost of ownership. I figured out that it was costing me on average $100 in maintenance per 1000 miles travelled. It may sound silly to have sold the Subaru and bought a Jeep that was 9 years older but I have zero regrets doing so.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/http/cookies/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? HTTP cookies are small bits of text that are included with each HTTP request made from a user&#39;s web browser to web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means each requests is treated as a unique command, and no state data is maintained. Cookies were designed to fill this gap, and allow servers to associate data with user&#39;s as they traverse sites. Cookies are commonly used by sites to hold authentication tokens, tracking ids, or save user preferences.</description>

      <description>Intro If you were expecting a phone call from a friend, you (hopefully) wouldn&#39;t sit by the phone and continuously pick it up to see if your friend was on the other end. Instead, you&#39;d wait to be notified of an incoming call when the phone started ringing or vibrating. Sitting by the phone and picking it up over and over again is a form of what&#39;s known as polling.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - Taking The Magic Out of Magic Strings</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/magic-strings/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/magic-strings/</guid>
      <description>What&#39;s so Magical About Magic Strings? Magic strings are string literals strewn about a code base that apply some kind of limitation to the code. They can be used to filter valid input, constrain parameters, or control the behavior of code.
They are often considered an anti-pattern due to how to they introduce the potential for bugs when typos occur, or by the difficulty they create when the need to change a magic string occurs.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Symptoms of Bad Code</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/symptons-of-bad-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 19:59:42 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/symptons-of-bad-code/</guid>
      <description>Admit it, we&#39;ve all written bad code at some point in our software development careers. One could even argue it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to write bad code when the situation calls for it. Bad code is perfect for cranking out minimum viable products, or implementing a last minute fix for a critical bug in production that has management breathing down the back of your neck waiting for a solution.
The catch-22 however, is that bad code should only be brought to life when it will have a life-span so short that death is already looming in the shadows waiting to snatch it.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - How To Set Up A New Project</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/setting-up-a-typescript-project/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/setting-up-a-typescript-project/</guid>
      <description>Summary For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&#39;s &amp;ldquo;JavaScript that scales&amp;rdquo;, and once you use it you&#39;ll never go back. But finding a decent tutorial on how to set up a new TypeScript project is quite the challenge. Many tutorials are out-dated and want you to install other packages such as gulp, jump through hoops, or even sacrifice your first born child (okay maybe not but still).</description>

      <description>The Less You Know, The Better Do you think the automotive designers who carefully crafted each body line and roll of your car&#39;s chassis cared about the engine&#39;s cylinder bore or stroke? Or perhaps the firing order, or whether the engine had 2 spark plugs per cylinder akin to Chrysler&#39;s hemis?
Of course not, all they cared about were the more important details such as dimensions, mounting positions, electrical connections, and plumbing points.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Marker Interfaces</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 05:12:42 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/marker-interfaces/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? A marker interface is an empty interface (no methods or properties) that is used to identify classes that implement it belong to a special group. Some might argue that this is a code smell, but in certain situations they can be the best solution for constraining types.
It should be noted that the purpose of marker interfaces is a perfect job for the decorator pattern. However, in some languages (C# for example) attributes lack the support we need to implement a quick solution.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/magic-numbers/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? Magic numbers are numbers in code that appear to be arbitrary, but actually serve a purpose. They are commonly described as an anti-pattern as they diminish code quality, and are &amp;ldquo;referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s&amp;rdquo;. [1]
However, this does not mean that all constants should be blindly replaced with pre-defined constants.</description>

      <description>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.
The funny thing is, when I was preparing to drop the B20B engine into the Civic I clearly remember thinking how pointless it would be to replace the thermostat.</description>

Initially the plan for this weekend was to finish welding in the new driver side rocker panel. However, I managed to screw up trimming it to fit and had to order another replacement which wont be in for about a week.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Dependency Injection and Inversion</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/dependency-injection/</guid>
      <description>What are they? While it may seem like nothing more than buzz words, dependency injection is a well known principle. In fact, you&#39;ve likely used it yourself in the past and just didn&#39;t know the technique had a name. Dependency injection can be thought of as passing a resource required by a class to the class through one of several means. While the class could instantiate a new instance of the resource itself, by using dependency injection we introduce an easier way to take advantage of dependency inversion.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Unit Tests vs Integration Tests</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/unit-tests-vs-integration-tests/</guid>
      <description>Preface Unit tests and integration tests are designed to serve two different purposes. They are not meant to substitute each other, and each type has a specific focus. However, developers tend to struggle to determine the border that seperates unit tests and integration tests as there is no set hard limit on either one.
What is a Unit Test? Unit is somewhat of an ambiguous term, but in this situation it can be thought of as the smallest piece of code that can be isolated from the rest of the program.</description>

      <description>Where I&#39;ve Been, and Where I&#39;m Heading I took somewhat of an unplanned hiatus from working on No Mans Blocks. Initially, I took a break because I wanted to pursue writing a server for a Reddit clone. It wasn&#39;t until about two months in that I realized just how over scoped the project was and how long it would take to finish. While I may not have much to show for this time, it did open my eyes up to some of the common software-architecture patterns, and how to utilize these patterns to better organize my projects.</description>

      <description>Validating Objects Based on Context It&#39;s quite typical for a Domain Driven Design (DDD) project to need validation for it&#39;s domain models. While it may be sufficient to solve this by adding an IsValid() method to each model, this can cause confusion for the developer by cluttering the model class, and/or by requiring the IsValid() method to be generalized that it covers a large range of validation rules for any situation that may arise.</description>

      <description>Passenger side rocker replacement This post is the second part in my mini-series of restoring my old xj cherokee. If your interested, check out my attempt at saving the rusty roof.
Like most xjs out there, especially those in the rustier parts of the US, the rocker panels needed some love. I never really captured a good before shot of the rust on the passenger side rocker. It was roughly 9&amp;rdquo; in length and about 3&amp;rdquo; wide.</description>

      <description>Going all out This post is a successor to my first attempt at [building a standing desk] ( /post/misc/desk/). Back during college when I built my first desk I didn&#39;t have much of a budget since it was a spur of the moment decision. Because of this the solution I came up with ended up being a permanent standing desk built using misc. parts from Lowe&#39;s. Ever since graduating from college however, I&#39;ve found it less than thrilling to come home and stand at my desk after standing all day at work.</description>

      <description>Repainting the Cherokee&#39;s roof I&#39;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&#39;t be beat. Since my civic is far from snow worthy I also own a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. It may not be the prettiest vehicle out there but it&#39;s never let me down, and has successfully travelled 20,000 miles in it&#39;s first year of owner ship with a couple road trips ranging in the 800-1000 mile range.</description>

      <description>Part 3: Setting up MySQL Server If you&#39;ve made it this far your on the home stretch! In this part we&#39;ll be configuring Ubuntu, and setting up MySQL Server. If you haven&#39;t already, load up the Ubuntu VM.
While this is optional, I highly recommend giving your server a static IP address. Normally the router is reponsible for handing out IP addresses but since we will be connecting to this through code we really don&#39;t want to have to update the address every single time in the database connection.</description>

Okay I lied. There&#39;s actually one last step we need to do and that&#39;s specify the location of our Ubuntu ISO file that we downloaded earlier.</description>

      <description>Part 1: Setting up Virtual Box Welcome! This is part 1 of my 3 part series that will teach you how to start up an instance of MySQL server running in a Ubuntu virtual machine. This is great for when you need a temporary or non public database server for development. Before we begin though you&#39;ll need a few resources.
Download the following:
 VirtualBox Ubuntu (Desktop)  Why Desktop? Well, when it comes to Ubuntu both versions are nearly identical.</description>

      <description>Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&#39;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.</description>

      <description>Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&#39;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&#39;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&#39;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin. Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap. I ended up buying just a generic pin for the clutch master cylinder to hook it to the clutch pedal.</description>

Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&#39;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</description>

      <description>Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&#39;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&#39;t that bad.</description>

      <description>Implementing a Thread-Safe Queue One of the most useful data structures when it comes to multi-threading is the queue. However, queues in c# aren&#39;t thread-safe by default. Thankfully it&#39;s easy enough to implement your own as we will do today. Let&#39;s start by defining our class.
public class ThreadableQueue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { } If your unfamiliar with generics check out this link. Within the class we need to define two members.
private Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; queue; privare readonly object lockObj; The queue needs to be kept private so we can control access to it.</description>

      <description>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&#39;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&#39;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&#39;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</description>

      <description>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&#39;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&#39;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</description>

      <description>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&#39;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&#39;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&amp;hellip;). Here&#39;s how it looked before touching it at all.</description>

      <description>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&#39;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&#39;s message events.</description>

      <description>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&#39;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.
I remembered I had some left over 3m vinyl wrap sitting in the basement and decided to try something different.</description>

      <description>Wrapping it up It&#39;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</description>

I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I&#39;ve compiled a list of what I found below.</description>

      <description>I like projects And I&#39;m the kind of person that can&#39;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&#39;s totally different, it&#39;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap.

      <description>Sometimes we want code that can run outside of Unity And that can make things tricky when it comes to writing text to console. Unity has it&#39;s own set of methods for writing to it&#39;s command console via the Debug class with the most commonly used one being Debug.Log(). However in the event you want to create a library of code that can be run within Unity or in the command console (say a game server for example) you&#39;ll need a way to differentiate between the running environments.</description>

      <description>Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&#39;ve been on a tangent that wasn&#39;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&#39;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&#39;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:</description>

      <description>GameObject.Instantiate() is Expensive Creating new gameobjects during runtime can be a costly operation. Multiple this action by 10 or more times in a single frame and you&#39;ll notice a slight hiccup in FPS. One option to counter this is by taking advantage of object pooling. Object pooling is when a collection of inactive gameobjects is kept on standby. When the game needs a new object it can call upon the pool to retrieve an already instantiated instance.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Full algorithm is at the bottom. Classes for Block, Chunk, and MeshData are defined below the intro.
This article goes over how to implement a greedy meshing algorithm for generating optimized meshes for vertex-colored voxels in Unity. The algorithm is derived from Robert O&#39;Leary, with a few alterations made.
The setup has been simplified, and assumes the world is only comprised of a single chunk that holds all the blocks.</description>

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the stock antenna and it was broken so I figured we should delete it. My Dad helped out by soldering in a small patch to cover the antenna hole then skim coated it with body filler until you couldn&#39;t even tell it was ever there.</description>

Like every other civic / older Honda out there the wiper arms had basically all but lost their OEM paint. I wanted to fix them up so instead of buying new ones I sandblasted and powder coated mine with a nice matte black powder coat.</description>

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&#39;t resist making the switch.
While it was kinda gross, it actually cleaned up pretty nicely. After a lot of scrubbing and cleaning it was finally ready for paint.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&#39;s a fact.
My first car was a 1999 Acura RL that I purchased from my Grandmother. The car was in rough shape, and needed some love but it was an amazing first car. I put over 36k miles on the car in 3 years, and loved everything about it.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been fairly quiet since I&#39;ve just been enjoying the car. I&#39;ve moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There&#39;s nothing wrong with it I&#39;m just bored of it. I really want something that can be modded a little more. There&#39;s almost no aftermarket support for the RL so everything has to be done custom.
It took a month to sell but this is the last pic of it.</description>

      <description>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.
On the newer RLs they came with paint matched side skirts. I decided I want them as well.
Not bad for spray paint. This was after hitting them with a buff.
I also made another custom debadged grill.</description>

      <description>With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.
Lou&#39;s Exhaust in Portland did the install job. He even made some custom tips for it. I really like how it&#39;s tucked up nice and high and can&#39;t be seen.
Overall it sounds nice albeit a little loud.</description>

      <description>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.
This was my first time tinting, and has a few flaws but I&#39;m happy with the outcome.</description>

      <description>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&#39;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button. Other than that everything is 100% stock.
Installed. I was hoping to match the bezel closer to the radio but it was pretty hard finding the right black.
Winter shot.
I love the color that the projectors give off. That and the custom lighting in the cluster is a how upgrade over the stock setup.</description>

      <description>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&#39;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.
I decided to cut open my tail lights and remove the amber manually. I also made custom sequential blinkers with Cree LEDs that are bright as hell.
I really like how they came out. I&#39;m a huge fan of the minimalistic look and the tail lights paired with the debadge of the &amp;ldquo;Acura&amp;rdquo; logo looks nice.</description>

      <description>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&#39;s time. However, it hasn&#39;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&#39;s failing hard drive. I&#39;ve decided to attempt a tablet retrofit using the bezel of a newer GPS system that came in the 2002+ RL.
This is after seperating the rest of the GPS display from the bezel.</description>

      <description>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.
There isn&#39;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&#39;t too bad.
The new D2S bulbs also came in. They&#39;re much brighter than the D2Rs. Vertical height is different because I didn&#39;t bother to align that since it was so cold out. All glare in the second photo is due to the ice, and lack of shrouds around the projectors.</description>

      <description>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications. My desk is a mess right now.
I made some cuts with a dremel and then used the heat gun to reshape the cap to give more clearance.</description>

      <description>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.
I did a test fit of how everything will look. I&#39;m liking how it&#39;s coming out but I may re-install my side blinker defusers as I don&#39;t like the look as much due to the projector.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve decided to do a projector retrofit. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the current headlights I just really like the appeal of the crisp cutoff.
I separated the lense from the headlight house so I could begin to mount things in place. Took a little bit of work with the heat gun but I managed to remove them safely.
Test fit of the Apollo shroud.
Future look to come.
The shrouds needed a little trimming to fit in place but things are starting to look good.</description>

      <description>I bought my first car off my Grandmother. It&#39;s a 1999 Acura 3.5RL in rough condition. I&#39;ve owned it for about 3 years now and only done a few small mods to it since. Over this winter I plan on restoring it bit by bit to get it back to it&#39;s former glorly.
The photos don&#39;t really do it justice but the car has scratches and was missing paint all over the bumpers.</description>
