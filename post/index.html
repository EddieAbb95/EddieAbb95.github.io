    Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.  <a href="/post/civic/4-14-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&hellip;). Here&rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.  <a href="/post/civic/4-12-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&rsquo;s message events.  <a href="/post/nomansblocks/4-8-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.  <a href="/post/civic/4-8-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    Wrapping it up It&rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.  <a href="/post/civic/4-6-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    Trying to find the size of a missing bolt? I&rsquo;m in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many. I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I found below.  <a href="/post/honda/b-series-bolts/">Read More...</a>

    I like projects And I&rsquo;m the kind of person that can&rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&rsquo;s totally different, it&rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap.

    My Budget Build At my work, I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&rsquo;s left me pretty happy.  <a href="/post/misc/desk/">Read More...</a>

    Sometimes we want code that can run outside of Unity And that can make things tricky when it comes to writing text to console. Unity has it&rsquo;s own set of methods for writing to it&rsquo;s command console via the Debug class with the most commonly used one being Debug.Log(). However in the event you want to create a library of code that can be run within Unity or in the command console (say a game server for example) you&rsquo;ll need a way to differentiate between the running environments.  <a href="/post/unity/debug-logging/">Read More...</a>

    Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&rsquo;ve been on a tangent that wasn&rsquo;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&rsquo;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&rsquo;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:  <a href="/post/nomansblocks/3-31-18-update/">Read More...</a>

    GameObject.Instantiate() is Expensive Creating new gameobjects during runtime can be a costly operation. Multiple this action by 10 or more times in a single frame and you&rsquo;ll notice a slight hiccup in FPS. One option to counter this is by taking advantage of object pooling. Object pooling is when a collection of inactive gameobjects is kept on standby. When the game needs a new object it can call upon the pool to retrieve an already instantiated instance.  <a href="/post/unity/object-pool/">Read More...</a>

    What is Greedy Meshing? Anyone who has spent some time working with voxels will have heard of the term &lsquo;Greedy Meshing&rsquo; at some point. If your new to the concept check out this article written by Mikola Lysenko. It&rsquo;s probably the most popular (and if not best) article out there regarding voxel mesh generation.
However if your like me, your probably looking for a simpler explanation and perhaps some source code to really get the ball rolling, and improve your understanding.  <a href="/post/voxel/greedy-mesh/">Read More...</a>

    Welcome! If your reading this, it means you&rsquo;ve found my new website. It&rsquo;s still in it&rsquo;s early stages so it may seem quite primitive. It&rsquo;s powered via Hugo, and while I may have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JS, Go is a whole new concept.
In the following weeks I&rsquo;ll work on dialing things in and at the same time post progresss about my various projects I&rsquo;m working on.
