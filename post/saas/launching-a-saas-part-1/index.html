<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This is the first part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/saas/launching-a-saas-part-1/">Part 1: The Landing Page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/saas/launching-a-saas-part-2/">Part 2: The Launch</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-software-as-a-service">What is Software as a Service?</h1>

<p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a common method for licensing, and delivering web based applications. SaaS allows for clients to use software without having to manage, or install anything. Revenue is typically generated by charging a subscription based membership monthly, or yearly.</p>

<p>SaaS makes it easier for entrepreneurs to run a software company as it reduces the cost of distribution to almost zero. At the same time it opens up the possibility of creating a continuous integration (CI) / delivery (CD) pipeline.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages in SaaS is since the software is hosted remotely, it becomes much easier to release updates. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about getting every client to update their software, and you won&rsquo;t have to support multiple versions at once.</p>

<h1 id="this-project">This Project</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to preface this section by mentioning that my two favorite hobbies are cars, and coding. If I&rsquo;m not working on one, then I&rsquo;m likely working on the other. I enjoy doing my own maintenance, and repairs on my vehicles because it let&rsquo;s me ensure things were done right, and I can go the extra mile. The biggest downside to this however, is that I accumulate a lot of small receipts for parts or supplies needed. These receipts are often lost within a week of the repair, and it can be a real pain to track one down when I need to return or warranty out a part.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where this project comes into play. I plan on building a vehicle maintenance logging application that will allow users to record services or repairs performed, upload their receipts, and schedule reminders for upcoming maintenance. I&rsquo;ve picked this project because it&rsquo;s a problem I struggle with, and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m passionate about.</p>

<p>SaaS is inherently boring. It&rsquo;s so boring that unless you can find a problem that you struggle with, or find value in the solution, and plan to use it yourself, then you&rsquo;ll likely fail due to a loss of motivation. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve picked this project, the scope isn&rsquo;t too large, and solves a problem I deal with quite often.</p>

<h1 id="launch-day-isn-t-magical">Launch Day Isn&rsquo;t Magical</h1>

<p>Unless the product is something absolutely amazing (which we all like to think our projects are, but probably aren&rsquo;t sadly) then there isn&rsquo;t some massive group of users waiting to use it. That&rsquo;s why you need to start building your product&rsquo;s online presence as soon as possible to help attract potential customers.</p>

<p>This can be done through methods such as social media, building a landing page, and more. I&rsquo;ve decided to start off with building a landing page as it felt like the perfect practice for going through the steps of releasing software into the wild.</p>

<h1 id="the-landing-page">The Landing Page</h1>

<p>The landing page is the first interaction potential customers will have with your product. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be over the top, but it should be visually appealing, and not look slapped together. There&rsquo;s an abundance of resources written by better qualified authors on what a good landing page is comprised of so I&rsquo;d recommend checking them out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436858/coming-soon-page">https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436858/coming-soon-page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://speckyboy.com/beautiful-coming-soon-pages-inspiration/">https://speckyboy.com/beautiful-coming-soon-pages-inspiration/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples">https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to DIY this portion of the project myself since it seemed like a fun little challenge. There&rsquo;s already plenty of services out there such as <a href="https://www.launchrock.com/">LaunchRock</a> or <a href="https://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a> but I wanted to see what it took to publish my own.</p>

<p>In the end, this is what I came up with:
<img src="https://eddieabbondanz.io/img/saas/launching-a-saas-part-1/desktop.png" class="image-center"></p>

<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>

<p>The landing page is hosted via <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. They have a very budget friendly $5/mo tier droplet, and an amazing collection of how to articles for noobs like me. The server itself is running Ubuntu, and I&rsquo;m using Nginx as a reverse proxy.</p>

<p>The project itself is built on Node.js and uses TypeScript, Express, SQLite, and Helmet. I decided against using a templating engine such as React or Angular since it felt like hammering in a nail using a sledge hammer, and would bloat the project. I also decided against using an ORM since the only thing stored in the database is emails, and their date of entry. I did opt to use the CSS library Bootstrap to help speed up development of the web page itself, but did not include JQuery, or any of their JavaScript.</p>

<p>To handle automatically restarting the server when it crashes I&rsquo;m using PM2. PM2 is pretty easy to set up, and opens up the door for a continuous deployment pipeline down the road.</p>

<h2 id="server-side">Server Side</h2>

<p>The code to run the server is so small that I was tempted to write everything in a single file. In the end I decided to split it up into 3 files that way I could write a promise based wrapper around SQLite such that I could use the async / await keywords TypeScript offers.</p>

<p>Like other Node.js projects, the entry point is <code>index.ts</code>. This simply wraps a try catch around everything and prepares the server and database. The real magic takes place in <code>server.ts</code>.</p>

<p>To help serve static files I&rsquo;m using the <code>Express.static()</code> middleware. Everything that should be served to users is located under the <code>/static/</code> directory of the project.</p>

<p>The server itself only listens on three different routes.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/</code> - User visiting the page, serve them the html / css / js</li>
<li><code>/subscribe/</code> - The user has submitted an email, save it to the database</li>
<li><code>/robots.txt</code> - The site is being crawled, and the bot wants the <code>robots.txt</code> file</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">        //Handle web requests
        this._app.get('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
            res.sendFile(Path.resolve('static/main.html'));

<h2 id="client-side">Client Side</h2>

<p>The html for the page is located in <code>/static/page.html</code> (creative right?), and requires a few other resources such as <code>style.css</code>, <code>script.js</code> along with a couple images. The only purpose of the JavaScript on the page is to wire up the send button, and send off the user&rsquo;s email to the server.</p>

<p>The client side code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">(function () {
    let sendButton   = document.getElementById('button-send');
    let emailTextbox = document.getElementById('textbox-email');
    let successMsg   = document.getElementById('good-message');
    let errorMsg     = document.getElementById('bad-message');

    //Prepare the send button
    sendButton.addEventListener('click', sendRequest);

    /**
     * Send a subscribe request to the server
     */
    function sendRequest() {
        let httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

        //Does it have an email address in it?
        if(!/^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$/.test(emailTextbox.value)) {
            alert('Please enter a valid email.')
            return;
        }

        httpRequest.open('POST', 'http://mechaniclog.net/subscribe', true);
        httpRequest.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

        httpRequest.send(JSON.stringify({
            email: emailTextbox.value
        }));

        //Listen for a response
        httpRequest.onload = function () {
            if (this.status == 200) {
                successMsg.className = 'row';
                errorMsg.className   = 'row d-none';
            }
            else {
                successMsg.className = 'row d-none';
                errorMsg.className   = 'row';
            }

            document.getElementById('input-row').className ='row d-none';
        };
    }
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to Bootstrap&rsquo;s grid I was able to design a page that resized automatically to cater to mobile users.</p>

<p><img src="https://eddieabbondanz.io/img/saas/launching-a-saas-part-1/mobile.png" class="image-center"></p>

<p>A nice feature offered by FireFox, and Chrome is the ability to view the web page as a mobile user via their development tools. These tools should not be used as a replacement to an actual test device, but can help speed up prototyping.</p>

<p>I learnt this lesson the hard way as I only tested via FireFox&rsquo;s dev tools, and it backfired on me after launching and loading up the site on my phone. The site looked like garbage all because I forgot one little tag.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Smaller devices such as phones or tablets render web pages in a different manner than computers. They render using a &ldquo;virtual viewport&rdquo; which allows them to display the entire web page at once. From there the user can zoom or reposition their view to a more readable size.</p>

<p>This tag was introduced by Apple in an attempt to make web pages that aren&rsquo;t optimized for mobile look good. Initially only Safari supported it, but &ldquo;many other mobile browsers now support this tag, although it is not part of any web standard&rdquo; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t plan on focusing on the mobile market, you should still prepare a mobile friendly site. As of 2018, of all web pages served, 52% were served to mobile users <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241462/global-mobile-phone-website-traffic-share/">[2]</a>. Nobody cares for a site that doesn&rsquo;t look good on mobile, and there&rsquo;s plenty of resources available to help with designing responsive sites.</p>

<p>If your interested in seeing the site live you can visit it at: <a href="http://mechaniclog.net/">http://mechaniclog.net/</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the code behind it check out the <a href="https://github.com/EddieAbbondanzio/MechanicLog.Landing">Github repository</a>.</p>
