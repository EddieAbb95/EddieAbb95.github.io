    <p>Directly below the floor of the XJ in the cargo area sits the gas tank. Tucked tight between the frame rails it rests a mere 1/2&quot; from the floor. The mount for the gas tank is also what braces the floor in the cargo area.
<img src="images/1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s how the OEM set up is at least. In my case I had a large gaping hole with nothing there.</p>
<p>Shortly after completing the rear crossmember and realizing how hard fabrication really is I began to dread having to build a new gas tank cradle. But thanks to the frame rails going smoothly I had a new found confidence that let me more forward and ignore those fears.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take many pictures during the initial design phase as I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was building until I got about halfway through. Several searches on the internet dug up no results so there&rsquo;s a slim chance this might be the first custom gas tank mount for the OEM tank in an XJ.
<img src="images/2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The mount is made using a run of 1x1 16ga tubing in the front, and almost half of a 2x2 16ga tube for the angled mount thingy. The bends on this piece were too close for my metal brake to replicate. That&rsquo;s why the flat edges running along the 2x2 tube piece are welded. A better metal brake would have made this part much easier to build.</p>
<p>The angles on the mount are to hold the gas tank in position and prevent it from sliding forward or backwards when accelerating or braking.</p>
<p><img src="images/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Example of how it sits on the tank
<img src="images/4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To build each side I started with this.
<img src="images/5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>From there I cut off 7 inches of the top, and made two 3&quot; cuts further into the sides.
<img src="images/6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then a small angle was made and some scrap was welded into the sides.
<img src="images/7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And another piece of 2x2 tubing was then welded in to create the raised edge.
<img src="images/9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A quick test fit was done to determine where to weld the new piece on.
<img src="images/10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The steep slope at the front was made using even more 2x2 tubing that was cut similar to a set of stairs.
<img src="images/12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To ensure the gas tank strap had a solid mounting point an additional plate of 1/8&quot; steel was welded on to the front of the steep sloped part. Then two holes were drilled and the space between them was filed to create a mounting point for the gas tank straps.
<img src="images/13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be using a set of OE gas tank straps. I&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into making sure OEM parts still work with all of my custom stuff.</p>
<p>I cleaned up the gas tank strap mounts by welding in filler and grinding the edges until they were smooth.
<img src="images/14.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And after that I sandblasted it to prepare for paint. There was some tight spots I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could get my hand and sandpaper into so I figured this was the best choice.
<img src="images/15.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then two coats of epoxy primer later it was ready to be installed. After I spray a part and let it dry overnight I&rsquo;ll pour the remaining paint into any tubing to try to coat every inch. I don&rsquo;t want rust finding a new home inside my work.
<img src="images/16.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>With the gas tank cradle ready to go I squared it up into position and put a few tack welds to hold it in place. To make sure it was good to go I jacked up the gas tank for a test fit.
<img src="images/17.jpg" alt="">
<img src="images/18.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The tank is sitting a little lower than it will be when finally installed due to difficulties with holding it up via a jack.
<img src="images/19.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since the gas tank cradle supports the floor I ensured it was as level as possible too.
<img src="images/20.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A few more welds later the new cradle was fully installed.
<img src="images/21.jpg" alt="">
<img src="images/22.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It looks really cool against the new floor.
<img src="images/23.jpg" alt="">
<img src="images/24.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When I say floor I mean patch panel.
<img src="images/25.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a patch panel for the pre-face lift (96 and older) Cherokees at that. I couldn&rsquo;t get my hands on anything better so I&rsquo;ll be building it out into a full fledged floor.</p>
