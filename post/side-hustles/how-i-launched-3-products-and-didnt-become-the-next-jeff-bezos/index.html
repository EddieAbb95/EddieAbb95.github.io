<article>
    <p>In the past ~12 months there's only been about a couple weeks where I didn't have some kind of side project I was working on. I'm just a very hands on person who loves working on projects and code feels like the perfect medium. Best of all it's almost free to produce and when you mess up you're not out a lot of money vs other hobbies like woodworking.</p>
<p>But code has been more than a hobby for me. It's what I went to college for and it's what landed me a developer position at a large corporation for 2 years. At that job though, I was very unhappy. It wasn't a bad company to work for, I just didn't enjoy corporate culture, the product, or the legacy codebase (most code originated before I was even born!).</p>
<p>That unhappiness is what drove me to start this journey of mine in hopes of finding something better. It may have taken me three times to learn the same lesson but I feel like I've gained a huge amount of experience from the past year. Hell, starting 2019 I had never done any serious web dev, let alone used any of the technologies I learned.</p>
<h1 id="product-1---mechaniclog">Product 1 - MechanicLog</h1>
<p>Enter product 1. This one began after I started spending too much time on HackerNews at work. I drank the Kool-Aid a little too hard and became convinced I could create a successful SaaS since HN said it was easy.</p>
<p>The idea was a website where users could log car repairs / maintenance, and track fuel mileage. I came up with the idea as I have a project car, and I often lose receipts for parts. I figured having a site where I could upload them would be the perfect place to save them in case I needed to return a part one day. Plus trying to remember when something was done and at what mileage isn't always easy.</p>
<p>Since I was hoping to make money from this project I knew I had to validate the idea a bit first. But I was afraid of carpet bombing various car forums to investigate if this would solve a problem others experienced so I decided to search for competitors already in the market.</p>
<p>During this search I found several promising competitors that all charged a bit for usage. This gave me some confidence as I figured if others could thrive then surely a new competitor could too. With some new found courage I decided it was time to get to work.</p>
<p>Even though I was fresh out of college and had no experience creating a website, let alone one that required a backend I thought I could make it happen. I can't find the exact date I started but I know development began shortly before the beginning of 2019 and I recall messing up the project so bad I nuked the git repo and restarted. Attempt 2 began January 7th 2019.</p>
<p>The tech stack for MechanicLog was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A front end built using Vue and TypeScript</li>
<li>A MySQL database</li>
<li>A Node.js backend written in TypeScript and Express</li>
<li>Deployed to a Ubuntu server via DigitalOcean</li>
</ul>
<p>I had never written TypeScript and only knew C#, along with some sprinkles of JavaScript before starting this. But after hacking away on it in every single spare minute I had (I spent ~24hrs a week on it outside of my full time job) for about 4 months the project came to fruition. Below is the only picture I have of it.</p>
<p><img src="images/mechanic-log.png" alt="MechanicLog Dashboard"></p>
<p>And while it wasn't much it was alive, and I figured it was time to market it. Thankfully I had totally thought of a marketing plan and how I would execute it /s. I had nothing, but after a lot of reading I decided I would try to market it by writing blog posts and building back links via Quora. I did manage to lay a few links down, and write some posts but it never amounted to much traffic.</p>
<p>During this time I added several more features to the site and eventually saw a couple users sign up for it but no one ever came back after their first login. I began to lose motivation with the project and decided I was done touching it with the last commit occurring on May 21st 2019.</p>
<p>I learned that while the idea was noble, it had no competitive edge over it's competitors. Others had a mobile app that made their service much more useful, especially when logging fuel mileage. Apparently most users like to calculate their fuel mileage while sitting in their car directly after fueling up, and for some reason they don't like to bring a laptop with a wifi connection to the gas station. Had I taken the time to interview potential clients way back in the beginning I would have been able to realize how large of a scope this project was before doing anything. I killed off the project realizing I would have to dump several more months into it to create a mobile app with no guarantee of success.</p>
<h1 id="product-2---updog">Product 2 - Updog</h1>
<p>Being truthful, Updog started before MechanicLog but I realized I was out of my league when I first attempted it back in 2018. It was also called Blurtle back then. Updog was suppose to be a Reddit clone. For some reason I was convinced I could build the next best social media site, and with the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; launch of MechanicLog I felt I had gained my sea legs.</p>
<p>Beginning on June 23, 2019 this project wen't much faster than MechanicLog thanks to having some experience under my belt. It took about 3 months of work but the product was launched on September 25, 2019. I really thought it might take off.</p>
<p><img src="images/updog.png" alt="Updog"></p>
<p>The tech stack for Updog was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A front end built using Vue and TypeScript</li>
<li>A PostgreSQL database</li>
<li>An ASP.NET Core Web API as the backend.</li>
<li>Deployed to a Ubuntu server again via DigitalOcean</li>
</ul>
<p>Proud to share off my amazing (to me) creation I took the plunge and decided to share it with r/programming.</p>
<p>It did not go well. In fact, it went so bad I actually deleted the post out of embarrassment. I can't imagine why though, it's not like anyone else has ever shared a Reddit clone there before.</p>
<p><img src="images/clones.png" alt="Clone wars"></p>
<p>Oh well, I ended up sharing it with the r/vuejs community and it ended up being well received and made it to the front page. The code is open source and has gained 44 stars on <a href="https://github.com/EddieAbbondanzio/Updog.in">GitHub</a> at the time of writing this.</p>
<p>This was a fun one to build but I realized how dumb it was after sharing it. If anyone else ever thinks they can build a Reddit clone I'll save you some time figuring out the killer feature. It's not anything to do with the code of the site, it's the community.</p>
<h1 id="product-3---the-clap-button">Product 3 - The Clap Button</h1>
<p>Tired of over scoping my projects so hard I figured I should set my sights on something smaller. I can't remember how I thought of it but I thought making a micro SaaS that would enable static blogs to have a clap button similar to mediums would be pretty fly.</p>
<p>If you've noticed a repeating theme between each project, you're about to have deja vu. Once again I never interviewed any potential users about if this would solve a problem they were experiencing with their blog. Instead, I foolishly validated the idea by finding a competitor that had a <strong>free</strong> version.</p>
<p>With my mind set on the idea I jumped in head first and created a nifty little clap button widget. I felt it was well polished, and even added missing features from the competitor such as the ability to hold click for rapid claps like on Medium. This took about 2 months of work to create (I had very little free time for it) but I did complete it and even open sourced it on <a href="https://github.com/EddieAbbondanzio/clapbutton">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>With the button ready I whipped up a quick mvp for the dashboard portion of it and a basic landing page using up another 2 months of my free time. To help save some time I extracted out the core of the backend running Updog so I wouldn't have to replicate a ton of boilerplate code. That alone probably saved a month.</p>
<p>Deploying it took some time as I decided I wanted to learn how to create a continuous deployment pipeline using Jenkins and had to learn Docker to achieve it. But I did and sure enough number 3 was live on January 12th 2020.</p>
<p><img src="images/clapbutton.png" alt="The clap"></p>
<p>Excited to share my new found creation, but not really sure who to share it with I decided on sharing it to HackerNews. Nervous, but curious what others might think I posted it up.</p>
<p>After 24 hours it received a staggering 3 points and 1 comment. The sole comment was on point saying it was a neat idea but it didn't justify charging for the service powering it. Instead of taking it as a challenge to add more functionality, I realized that it was a harsh truth but one I should have realized much sooner. The fact that Facebook doesn't charge to use their like button should have been a bit obvious.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I know what you're probably thinking. Why in the world would you repeat the same mistake 3 times over 12 months? Isn't it obvious you actually need to talk with potential end users and determine if the solution actually solves a problem they have and are willing to pay for?</p>
<p>Sadly, yeah it's obvious where I went wrong now. But I'm a developer at heart and I always convinced myself that code could fix anything. Afraid to share your new idea? Add more features to make it better. No ones using it? Better add more features so they will. It wasn't well received? Clearly needs more features&hellip;</p>
<p>The last project was finally able to break through my stubbornness and prove to me it's not about the idea, it's about the problem. I'm ready to stop spitting out random ideas, and instead only start a project if I can collect at least 10 emails of interested potential users.</p>
<p>Also I'm no longer working as a developer. I left the company back in May to start my own business doing auto detailing. I think it's why I started Updog around the same time. I felt anything was achievable at the time.</p>
