<h1 id="repainting-the-cherokee-s-roof">Repainting the Cherokee&rsquo;s roof</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of
parts really can&rsquo;t be beat. Since my civic is far from snow worthy I also own a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. It may not be the prettiest
vehicle out there but it&rsquo;s never let me down, and has successfully travelled 20,000 miles in it&rsquo;s first year of owner ship with
a couple road trips ranging in the 800-1000 mile range.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/9-3-18/1.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>However, with the way Chrystler OEM paint is, the roof was well overdue for a touch up.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really like the thought of repainting the roof with OEM paint as the rest of the body is quite beat, and I&rsquo;m constantly
putting things in the roof basket and didn&rsquo;t want to cause scratches. Because of this I decided to go with truck bed liner.</p>

<p>Unlike most though I made an honest effort to eliminate any pre-existing rust before painting and took the time to sandblast the
entire roof. I forgot to take a before shot after stripping all the paint but here&rsquo;s a mid progress shot of the sandblasting.</p>

<p>Then once everything was sandblasted I did a quick pass using the DA with 80 grit to ensure the paint would have a nice
surface to mate to.</p>

<p>A base coat of POR15 and two coats of bed liner later the roof was done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the outcome. At first I was a little unsure because it looked blotchy, but the second coat of bedliner really evened things
out. Overall it&rsquo;s not too noticable unless your looking at it from above. I think with the roof basket back in place it will fit right in
with the style of the jeep.</p>

<p>Next fix on the jeep is going to be a new passenger side rocker panel&hellip;</p>
