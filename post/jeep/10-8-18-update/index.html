<h1 id="passenger-side-rocker-replacement">Passenger side rocker replacement</h1>

<p>This post is the second part in my mini-series of restoring my old xj cherokee. If your interested, check out my attempt at saving the <a href="/post/jeep/9-3-18-update/">rusty roof</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/1.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Like most xjs out there, especially those in the rustier parts of the US, the rocker panels needed some love. I never really captured a good before shot of the rust on the passenger side rocker. It was roughly 9&rdquo; in length and about 3&rdquo; wide. I finally decided it was time to fix it when I managed to puncture a hole in it using my key. (You can even see the hole in the picture if you look close).</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/2.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Knowing that the visible rust was likely only the tip of the iceberg I chopped out a moderate sized hole in the rocker using a 4&rdquo; cutting wheel on the grinder.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/3.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>The inside rocker was in much better shape than I was expecting. I had even purchased a set of replacement panels for the inner ones thinking I&rsquo;d need them, hopefully I can sell them via Craigslist.</p>

<p>After an adventure of using the sand blaster with black beauty the inner rocker was looking good as new.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to have to worry about the inside rusting out again so before welding the patch on I covered everything in a nice coat of POR15. If you do use POR15, be sure to wear gloves as I can assure you at three weeks later you&rsquo;ll still have black spots on your hands.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/6.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>A day later to ensure the POR15 was nice and dry it was finally time to start welding the patch on.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/7.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still quite the novice when it comes to welding so the results aren&rsquo;t exactly perfect.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/8.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>While the welds aren&rsquo;t the prettiest, they penetrated the body very nicely and the rocker feels solid as ever. Using a 2&rdquo; pneumatic grinder I worked down all of the messy beads to clean(ish) edges.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/10.jpg" class="image-center">
<img src="/imgs/jeep/10-8-18/11.jpg" class="image-center"></p>

<p>Once the welds were grinded down all the seams were hit with seam sealer. I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of this step since it was nothing spectacular. Then to give everything some texture, and hide any imperfections I sprayed the rocker with &ldquo;Stone Guard&rdquo; paint.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not showroom perfect, but hey for an 18 year old jeep it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable. I need to order some new scuff guards for the rockers since the screws holding mine in were rusted out and I ended up ripping the plastic guards out. In about a week I&rsquo;ll be tackling the other side.</p>
