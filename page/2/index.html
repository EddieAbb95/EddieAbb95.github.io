    <span class="post-date">Published Dec 21, 2018</span>
    <p>Overview This is the first part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Dec 7, 2018</span>
    <p>Admit it, we&rsquo;ve all written bad code at some point in our software development careers. One could even argue it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to write bad code when the situation calls for it. Bad code is perfect for cranking out minimum viable products, or implementing a last minute fix for a critical bug in production that has management breathing down the back of your neck waiting for a solution.
The catch-22 however, is that bad code should only be brought to life when it will have a life-span so short that death is already looming in the shadows waiting to snatch it.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Nov 26, 2018</span>
    <p>Summary For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&rsquo;s &ldquo;JavaScript that scales&rdquo;, and once you use it you&rsquo;ll never go back. But finding a decent tutorial on how to set up a new TypeScript project is quite the challenge. Many tutorials are out-dated and want you to install other packages such as gulp, jump through hoops, or even sacrifice your first born child (okay maybe not but still).</p>

    <p>The Less You Know, The Better Do you think the automotive designers who carefully crafted each body line and roll of your car&rsquo;s chassis cared about the engine&rsquo;s cylinder bore or stroke? Or perhaps the firing order, or whether the engine had 2 spark plugs per cylinder akin to Chrysler&rsquo;s hemis?
Of course not, all they cared about were the more important details such as dimensions, mounting positions, electrical connections, and plumbing points.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Nov 2, 2018</span>
    <p>What Are They? A marker interface is an empty interface (no methods or properties) that is used to identify classes that implement it belong to a special group. Some might argue that this is a code smell, but in certain situations they can be the best solution for constraining types.
It should be noted that the purpose of marker interfaces is a perfect job for the decorator pattern. However, in some languages (C# for example) attributes lack the support we need to implement a quick solution.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Oct 29, 2018</span>
    <p>What Are They? Magic numbers are numbers in code that appear to be arbitrary, but actually serve a purpose. They are commonly described as an anti-pattern as they diminish code quality, and are &ldquo;referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s&rdquo;. [1]
However, this does not mean that all constants should be blindly replaced with pre-defined constants.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Oct 26, 2018</span>
    <p>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.
The funny thing is, when I was preparing to drop the B20B engine into the Civic I clearly remember thinking how pointless it would be to replace the thermostat.</p>

    <p>Patching Holes This post is a continuation of the mini series about restoring my old XJ cherokee. In the previous post I talked about cutting out and welding in a new rocker panel.
Initially the plan for this weekend was to finish welding in the new driver side rocker panel. However, I managed to screw up trimming it to fit and had to order another replacement which wont be in for about a week.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Oct 18, 2018</span>
    <p>What are they? While it may seem like nothing more than buzz words, dependency injection is a well known principle. In fact, you&rsquo;ve likely used it yourself in the past and just didn&rsquo;t know the technique had a name. Dependency injection can be thought of as passing a resource required by a class to the class through one of several means. While the class could instantiate a new instance of the resource itself, by using dependency injection we introduce an easier way to take advantage of dependency inversion.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Oct 15, 2018</span>
    <p>Preface Unit tests and integration tests are designed to serve two different purposes. They are not meant to substitute each other, and each type has a specific focus. However, developers tend to struggle to determine the border that seperates unit tests and integration tests as there is no set hard limit on either one.
What is a Unit Test? Unit is somewhat of an ambiguous term, but in this situation it can be thought of as the smallest piece of code that can be isolated from the rest of the program.</p>
