  <p>Repainting the Cherokee&rsquo;s roof I&rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&rsquo;t be beat. Since my civic is far from snow worthy I also own a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. It may not be the prettiest vehicle out there but it&rsquo;s never let me down, and has successfully travelled 20,000 miles in it&rsquo;s first year of owner ship with a couple road trips ranging in the 800-1000 mile range.</p>

  <p>Part 3: Setting up MySQL Server If you&rsquo;ve made it this far your on the home stretch! In this part we&rsquo;ll be configuring Ubuntu, and setting up MySQL Server. If you haven&rsquo;t already, load up the Ubuntu VM.
While this is optional, I highly recommend giving your server a static IP address. Normally the router is reponsible for handing out IP addresses but since we will be connecting to this through code we really don&rsquo;t want to have to update the address every single time in the database connection.</p>

  <p>Part 2: Installing Ubuntu With out virtual machine ready to be fired up thanks to part 1, we are now ready to begin installing Ubuntu. If you don&rsquo;t have VirtualBox open, go ahead and do so now. Highlight the VM that we just set up and click Start
Okay I lied. There&rsquo;s actually one last step we need to do and that&rsquo;s specify the location of our Ubuntu ISO file that we downloaded earlier.</p>

  <p>Part 1: Setting up Virtual Box Welcome! This is part 1 of my 3 part series that will teach you how to start up an instance of MySQL server running in a Ubuntu virtual machine. This is great for when you need a temporary or non public database server for development. Before we begin though you&rsquo;ll need a few resources.
Download the following:
 VirtualBox Ubuntu (Desktop)  Why Desktop?</p>

  <p>Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&rsquo;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.</p>

  <p>Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin. Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap.</p>

  <p>Creating Time (literally!) I have a knack for forgetting what I&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish on the game during the week. To try to overcome this so I have updates I can post on it, I&rsquo;ve started writing down each accomplishment on a sticky note.
Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&rsquo;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</p>

  <p>Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&rsquo;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published May 9, 2018</span>
  <p>Implementing a Thread-Safe Queue One of the most useful data structures when it comes to multi-threading is the queue. However, queues in c# aren&rsquo;t thread-safe by default. Thankfully it&rsquo;s easy enough to implement your own as we will do today. Let&rsquo;s start by defining our class.
public class ThreadableQueue&lt;T&gt; { }  If your unfamiliar with generics check out this link. Within the class we need to define two members.</p>

  <p>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&rsquo;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&rsquo;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</p>
