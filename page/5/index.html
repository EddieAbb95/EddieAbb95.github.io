    <p>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.</p>

    <p>Wrapping it up It&rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</p>

    <p>Trying to find the size of a missing bolt? I&rsquo;m in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many. I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I found below.</p>

    <p>Who Am I? Welcome! My name&rsquo;s Eddie Abbondanzio, and this is my personal blog. I&rsquo;m a software developer who loves to work on his own projects whenever possible. I graduated from the University of Maine in Orono in 2018 with a BS in Computer Science. I&rsquo;m currently self-employed as an automotive detailer and run my own business: Ed&rsquo;s Auto Detailing. Blog posts will cover anything from software architecture, design patterns, web development, and occasionally updates from working on my cars.</p>

    <p>I like projects And I&rsquo;m the kind of person that can&rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&rsquo;s totally different, it&rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap. If your interested in it&rsquo;s full history check out my build thread on D-Series.</p>

    <p>My Budget Build At my work, I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&rsquo;s left me pretty happy.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Mar 31, 2018</span>
    <p>Sometimes we want code that can run outside of Unity And that can make things tricky when it comes to writing text to console. Unity has it&rsquo;s own set of methods for writing to it&rsquo;s command console via the Debug class with the most commonly used one being Debug.Log(). However in the event you want to create a library of code that can be run within Unity or in the command console (say a game server for example) you&rsquo;ll need a way to differentiate between the running environments.</p>

    <p>Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&rsquo;ve been on a tangent that wasn&rsquo;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&rsquo;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&rsquo;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Mar 30, 2018</span>
    <p>GameObject.Instantiate() is Expensive Creating new gameobjects during runtime can be a costly operation. Multiple this action by 10 or more times in a single frame and you&rsquo;ll notice a slight hiccup in FPS. One option to counter this is by taking advantage of object pooling. Object pooling is when a collection of inactive gameobjects is kept on standby. When the game needs a new object it can call upon the pool to retrieve an already instantiated instance.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published Mar 25, 2018</span>
    <p>TL;DR Full algorithm is at the bottom. Classes for Block, Chunk, and MeshData are defined below the intro.
This article goes over how to implement a greedy meshing algorithm for generating optimized meshes for vertex-colored voxels in Unity. The algorithm is derived from Robert O&rsquo;Leary, with a few alterations made.
The setup has been simplified, and assumes the world is only comprised of a single chunk that holds all the blocks.</p>
