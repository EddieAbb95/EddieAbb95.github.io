    <p>Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&rsquo;ve been on a tangent that wasn&rsquo;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&rsquo;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&rsquo;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:</p>

    <p>GameObject.Instantiate() is Expensive Creating new gameobjects during runtime can be a costly operation. Multiple this action by 10 or more times in a single frame and you&rsquo;ll notice a slight hiccup in FPS. One option to counter this is by taking advantage of object pooling. Object pooling is when a collection of inactive gameobjects is kept on standby. When the game needs a new object it can call upon the pool to retrieve an already instantiated instance.</p>

    <p>TL;DR Full algorithm is at the bottom. Classes for Block, Chunk, and MeshData are defined below the intro.
This article goes over how to implement a greedy meshing algorithm for generating optimized meshes for vertex-colored voxels in Unity. The algorithm is derived from Robert O&rsquo;Leary, with a few alterations made.
The setup has been simplified, and assumes the world is only comprised of a single chunk that holds all the blocks.</p>

    <p>Welcome! If your reading this, it means you&rsquo;ve found my new website. It&rsquo;s still in it&rsquo;s early stages so it may seem quite primitive. It&rsquo;s powered via Hugo, and while I may have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JS, Go is a whole new concept.
In the following weeks I&rsquo;ll work on dialing things in and at the same time post progresss about my various projects I&rsquo;m working on.
What is this blog about?</p>

    <p>Now that I&rsquo;m back at college it&rsquo;s been hard to make progress on the Civic. I do have a slight update to drop as the hood is just about done now.
I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the stock antenna and it was broken so I figured we should delete it. My Dad helped out by soldering in a small patch to cover the antenna hole then skim coated it with body filler until you couldn&rsquo;t even tell it was ever there.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&rsquo;m embarking on, and can&rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.
Like every other civic / older Honda out there the wiper arms had basically all but lost their OEM paint. I wanted to fix them up so instead of buying new ones I sandblasted and powder coated mine with a nice matte black powder coat.</p>

    <p>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&rsquo;t resist making the switch.
While it was kinda gross, it actually cleaned up pretty nicely. After a lot of scrubbing and cleaning it was finally ready for paint.</p>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&rsquo;s a fact.
My first car was a 1999 Acura RL that I purchased from my Grandmother. The car was in rough shape, and needed some love but it was an amazing first car. I put over 36k miles on the car in 3 years, and loved everything about it.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been fairly quiet since I&rsquo;ve just been enjoying the car. I&rsquo;ve moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it I&rsquo;m just bored of it. I really want something that can be modded a little more. There&rsquo;s almost no aftermarket support for the RL so everything has to be done custom.
It took a month to sell but this is the last pic of it.</p>

    <p>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &ldquo;curve&rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.
On the newer RLs they came with paint matched side skirts. I decided I want them as well.
Not bad for spray paint. This was after hitting them with a buff.
I also made another custom debadged grill.</p>
