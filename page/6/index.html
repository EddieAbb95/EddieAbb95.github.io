    <p>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &ldquo;curve&rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.
On the newer RLs they came with paint matched side skirts. I decided I want them as well.
Not bad for spray paint. This was after hitting them with a buff.
I also made another custom debadged grill.</p>

    <p>With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.
Lou&rsquo;s Exhaust in Portland did the install job. He even made some custom tips for it. I really like how it&rsquo;s tucked up nice and high and can&rsquo;t be seen.
Overall it sounds nice albeit a little loud.</p>

    <p>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.
This was my first time tinting, and has a few flaws but I&rsquo;m happy with the outcome.</p>

    <p>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&rsquo;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button. Other than that everything is 100% stock.
Installed. I was hoping to match the bezel closer to the radio but it was pretty hard finding the right black.
Winter shot.
I love the color that the projectors give off. That and the custom lighting in the cluster is a how upgrade over the stock setup.</p>

    <p>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&rsquo;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.
I decided to cut open my tail lights and remove the amber manually. I also made custom sequential blinkers with Cree LEDs that are bright as hell.
I really like how they came out. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the minimalistic look and the tail lights paired with the debadge of the &ldquo;Acura&rdquo; logo looks nice.</p>

    <p>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&rsquo;s time. However, it hasn&rsquo;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&rsquo;s failing hard drive. I&rsquo;ve decided to attempt a tablet retrofit using the bezel of a newer GPS system that came in the 2002+ RL.
This is after seperating the rest of the GPS display from the bezel.</p>

    <p>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.
There isn&rsquo;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&rsquo;t too bad.
The new D2S bulbs also came in. They&rsquo;re much brighter than the D2Rs. Vertical height is different because I didn&rsquo;t bother to align that since it was so cold out. All glare in the second photo is due to the ice, and lack of shrouds around the projectors.</p>

    <p>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications. My desk is a mess right now.
I made some cuts with a dremel and then used the heat gun to reshape the cap to give more clearance.</p>

    <p>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.
I did a test fit of how everything will look. I&rsquo;m liking how it&rsquo;s coming out but I may re-install my side blinker defusers as I don&rsquo;t like the look as much due to the projector.</p>
