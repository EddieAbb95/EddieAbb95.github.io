    <p>Creating Time (literally!) I have a knack for forgetting what I&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish on the game during the week. To try to overcome this so I have updates I can post on it, I&rsquo;ve started writing down each accomplishment on a sticky note.
Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&rsquo;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</p>

    <p>Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&rsquo;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

    <p>Implementing a Thread-Safe Queue One of the most useful data structures when it comes to multi-threading is the queue. However, queues in c# aren&rsquo;t thread-safe by default. Thankfully it&rsquo;s easy enough to implement your own as we will do today. Let&rsquo;s start by defining our class.
public class ThreadableQueue&lt;T&gt; { }  If your unfamiliar with generics check out this link. Within the class we need to define two members.</p>

    <p>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&rsquo;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&rsquo;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</p>

    <p>Connecting the Pieces It&rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&hellip;
To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&rsquo;ll only be used temporarily.</p>

    <p>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</p>

    <p>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&hellip;). Here&rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.</p>

    <p>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&rsquo;s message events.</p>

    <p>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.</p>

    <p>Wrapping it up It&rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</p>
