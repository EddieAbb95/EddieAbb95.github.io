  <p>Connecting the Pieces It&rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&hellip;
To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&rsquo;ll only be used temporarily.</p>

  <p>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</p>

  <p>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&hellip;). Here&rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.</p>

  <p>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&rsquo;s message events.</p>

  <p>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.</p>

  <p>Wrapping it up It&rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</p>

  <p>Trying to find the size of a missing bolt? I&rsquo;m in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many. I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I found below.</p>

  <p>I like projects And I&rsquo;m the kind of person that can&rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&rsquo;s totally different, it&rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap. If your interested in it&rsquo;s full history check out my build thread on D-Series.</p>

  <p>My Budget Build At my work, I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&rsquo;s left me pretty happy.</p>
