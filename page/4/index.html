    <p>Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&rsquo;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.</p>

    <p>Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin. Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap.</p>

    <p>Creating Time (literally!) I have a knack for forgetting what I&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish on the game during the week. To try to overcome this so I have updates I can post on it, I&rsquo;ve started writing down each accomplishment on a sticky note.
Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&rsquo;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</p>

    <p>Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&rsquo;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Published May 9, 2018</span>
    <p>Implementing a Thread-Safe Queue One of the most useful data structures when it comes to multi-threading is the queue. However, queues in c# aren&rsquo;t thread-safe by default. Thankfully it&rsquo;s easy enough to implement your own as we will do today. Let&rsquo;s start by defining our class.
public class ThreadableQueue&lt;T&gt; { }  If your unfamiliar with generics check out this link. Within the class we need to define two members.</p>

    <p>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&rsquo;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&rsquo;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</p>

    <p>Connecting the Pieces It&rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&hellip;
To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&rsquo;ll only be used temporarily.</p>

    <p>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</p>

    <p>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&hellip;). Here&rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.</p>

    <p>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&rsquo;s message events.</p>
