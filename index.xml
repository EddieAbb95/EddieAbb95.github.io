      <title>HTTP Status Codes For a RESTful API</title>

      <description>Intro Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) powers the web. It&amp;rsquo;s the silent work horse used to carry data between servers and clients, and is the reason why all URLs start with HTTP, or HTTPS. For those new to HTTP, it can be though of as clients (users) making requests that are sent to servers which then reply back with responses. Only servers can make responses, and only clients can make requests.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly been very lucky with my Jeep. My previous daily driver was a 2009 Subaru Legacy, and while it may have been excellent in the snow it had a very high cost of ownership. I figured out that it was costing me on average $100 in maintenance per 1000 miles travelled. It may sound silly to have sold the Subaru and bought a Jeep that was 9 years older but I have zero regrets doing so.</description>

      <title>HTTP Cookies</title>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/http/cookies/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? HTTP cookies are small bits of text that are included with each HTTP request made from a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser to web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means each requests is treated as a unique command, and no state data is maintained. Cookies were designed to fill this gap, and allow servers to associate data with user&amp;rsquo;s as they traverse sites. Cookies are commonly used by sites to hold authentication tokens, tracking ids, or save user preferences.</description>

      <description>Intro If you were expecting a phone call from a friend, you (hopefully) wouldn&amp;rsquo;t sit by the phone and continuously pick it up to see if your friend was on the other end. Instead, you&amp;rsquo;d wait to be notified of an incoming call when the phone started ringing or vibrating. Sitting by the phone and picking it up over and over again is a form of what&amp;rsquo;s known as polling.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - Taking The Magic Out of Magic Strings</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/typescript/magic-strings/</link>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/typescript/magic-strings/</guid>
      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s so Magical About Magic Strings? Magic strings are string literals strewn about a code base that apply some kind of limitation to the code. They can be used to filter valid input, constrain parameters, or control the behavior of code.
They are often considered an anti-pattern due to how to they introduce the potential for bugs when typos occur, or by the difficulty they create when the need to change a magic string occurs.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the second part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Symptoms of Bad Code</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/symptoms-of-bad-code/</link>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/symptoms-of-bad-code/</guid>
      <description>Admit it, we&amp;rsquo;ve all written bad code at some point in our software development careers. One could even argue it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to write bad code when the situation calls for it. Bad code is perfect for cranking out minimum viable products, or implementing a last minute fix for a critical bug in production that has management breathing down the back of your neck waiting for a solution.
The catch-22 however, is that bad code should only be brought to life when it will have a life-span so short that death is already looming in the shadows waiting to snatch it.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - How To Set Up A New Project</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/typescript/setting-up-a-typescript-project/</link>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/typescript/setting-up-a-typescript-project/</guid>
      <description>Summary For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;JavaScript that scales&amp;rdquo;, and once you use it you&amp;rsquo;ll never go back. But finding a decent tutorial on how to set up a new TypeScript project is quite the challenge. Many tutorials are out-dated and want you to install other packages such as gulp, jump through hoops, or even sacrifice your first born child (okay maybe not but still).</description>

      <description>The Less You Know, The Better Do you think the automotive designers who carefully crafted each body line and roll of your car&amp;rsquo;s chassis cared about the engine&amp;rsquo;s cylinder bore or stroke? Or perhaps the firing order, or whether the engine had 2 spark plugs per cylinder akin to Chrysler&amp;rsquo;s hemis?
Of course not, all they cared about were the more important details such as dimensions, mounting positions, electrical connections, and plumbing points.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Marker Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/marker-interfaces/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 05:12:42 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/marker-interfaces/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? A marker interface is an empty interface (no methods or properties) that is used to identify classes that implement it belong to a special group. Some might argue that this is a code smell, but in certain situations they can be the best solution for constraining types.
It should be noted that the purpose of marker interfaces is a perfect job for the decorator pattern. However, in some languages (C# for example) attributes lack the support we need to implement a quick solution.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Magic Numbers</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 19:16:42 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/magic-numbers/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? Magic numbers are numbers in code that appear to be arbitrary, but actually serve a purpose. They are commonly described as an anti-pattern as they diminish code quality, and are &amp;ldquo;referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s&amp;rdquo;. [1]
However, this does not mean that all constants should be blindly replaced with pre-defined constants.</description>

      <description>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.
The funny thing is, when I was preparing to drop the B20B engine into the Civic I clearly remember thinking how pointless it would be to replace the thermostat.</description>

      <description>Patching Holes This post is a continuation of the mini series about restoring my old XJ cherokee. In the previous post I talked about cutting out and welding in a new rocker panel.
Initially the plan for this weekend was to finish welding in the new driver side rocker panel. However, I managed to screw up trimming it to fit and had to order another replacement which wont be in for about a week.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Dependency Injection and Inversion</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/dependency-injection/</link>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/dependency-injection/</guid>
      <description>What are they? While it may seem like nothing more than buzz words, dependency injection is a well known principle. In fact, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely used it yourself in the past and just didn&amp;rsquo;t know the technique had a name. Dependency injection can be thought of as passing a resource required by a class to the class through one of several means. While the class could instantiate a new instance of the resource itself, by using dependency injection we introduce an easier way to take advantage of dependency inversion.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Unit Tests vs Integration Tests</title>
      <link>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/test-types/</link>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/test-types/</guid>
      <description>Preface Unit tests and integration tests are designed to serve two different purposes. They are not meant to substitute each other, and each type has a specific focus. However, developers tend to struggle to determine the border that seperates unit tests and integration tests as there is no set hard limit on either one.
What is a Unit Test? Unit is somewhat of an ambiguous term, but in this situation it can be thought of as the smallest piece of code that can be isolated from the rest of the program.</description>

      <description>Where I&amp;rsquo;ve Been, and Where I&amp;rsquo;m Heading I took somewhat of an unplanned hiatus from working on No Mans Blocks. Initially, I took a break because I wanted to pursue writing a server for a Reddit clone. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until about two months in that I realized just how over scoped the project was and how long it would take to finish. While I may not have much to show for this time, it did open my eyes up to some of the common software-architecture patterns, and how to utilize these patterns to better organize my projects.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Validator Pattern</title>

      <guid>https://EddieAbbondanzio.github.io/post/software-design/validator-pattern/</guid>
      <description>Validating Objects Based on Context It&amp;rsquo;s quite typical for a Domain Driven Design (DDD) project to need validation for it&amp;rsquo;s domain models. While it may be sufficient to solve this by adding an IsValid() method to each model, this can cause confusion for the developer by cluttering the model class, and/or by requiring the IsValid() method to be generalized that it covers a large range of validation rules for any situation that may arise.</description>

      <description>Passenger side rocker replacement This post is the second part in my mini-series of restoring my old xj cherokee. If your interested, check out my attempt at saving the rusty roof.
Like most xjs out there, especially those in the rustier parts of the US, the rocker panels needed some love. I never really captured a good before shot of the rust on the passenger side rocker. It was roughly 9&amp;rdquo; in length and about 3&amp;rdquo; wide.</description>

      <description>Going all out This post is a successor to my first attempt at building a standing desk. Back during college when I built my first desk I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a budget since it was a spur of the moment decision. Because of this the solution I came up with ended up being a permanent standing desk built using misc. parts from Lowe&amp;rsquo;s. Ever since graduating from college however, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it less than thrilling to come home and stand at my desk after standing all day at work.</description>

      <description>Repainting the Cherokee&amp;rsquo;s roof I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&amp;rsquo;t be beat. Since my civic is far from snow worthy I also own a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. It may not be the prettiest vehicle out there but it&amp;rsquo;s never let me down, and has successfully travelled 20,000 miles in it&amp;rsquo;s first year of owner ship with a couple road trips ranging in the 800-1000 mile range.</description>

      <description>Part 3: Setting up MySQL Server If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far your on the home stretch! In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll be configuring Ubuntu, and setting up MySQL Server. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, load up the Ubuntu VM.
While this is optional, I highly recommend giving your server a static IP address. Normally the router is reponsible for handing out IP addresses but since we will be connecting to this through code we really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to update the address every single time in the database connection.</description>

Okay I lied. There&amp;rsquo;s actually one last step we need to do and that&amp;rsquo;s specify the location of our Ubuntu ISO file that we downloaded earlier.</description>

While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.</description>

Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&amp;rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin. Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap.</description>

Every Friday I hope to write a small blurb, and post some code showing off the current state of No Mans Blocks. While the networking implementation is still early, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get a sever-authoratative set up running that handles syncing up lobby of players together.</description>

I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.
I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad.</description>

      <description>Implementing a Thread-Safe Queue One of the most useful data structures when it comes to multi-threading is the queue. However, queues in c# aren&amp;rsquo;t thread-safe by default. Thankfully it&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to implement your own as we will do today. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by defining our class.
public class ThreadableQueue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { }  If your unfamiliar with generics check out this link. Within the class we need to define two members.</description>

      <description>Playing Around at the Bit Level This weeks adventure has been exploring object serialization. Initially I was using the serializable attribute to convert my objects into byte arrays but for some objects such as the voxel chunks this is far from ideal. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to handle serialization with 2 different methods I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and roll my own set up.
To help prepare for this task I&amp;rsquo;ve created a BitManipulator class that allows for individual bits to be written to in a byte array.</description>

      <description>Connecting the Pieces It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&amp;rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&amp;hellip;
To help keep costs down I try to buy cheap things when I know they&amp;rsquo;ll only be used temporarily.</description>

      <description>Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&amp;rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.
Last year everytime I pushed the clutch in it made a real nice squeek that let everyone in a 15 foot radius know what was going on. Thankfully this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to grease the pivot point on the clutch fork.</description>

      <description>Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&amp;hellip;). Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all.</description>

      <description>Building Up the Network Logic While this week may not have much to show for it has built a solid foundation for networking. I spent some time refactoring the pre-existing network logic to try to clean things up. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like how the NetServerManager and NetClientManager derived from a base class of NetManager that had a NetMessageProcessor component. It was gross having to call that and subscribe to it&amp;rsquo;s message events.</description>

      <description>New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.</description>

      <description>Wrapping it up It&amp;rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.
Initially I wanted to work on finishing up the engine bay but with how cold it was outside I decided to focus on the motor instead.</description>

      <description>Trying to find the size of a missing bolt? I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many. I also had the pleasure of tracking down all this information from various forums and sources. To try to help any others who are partaking in a similar project I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of what I found below.</description>

      <description>I like projects And I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person that can&amp;rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&amp;rsquo;s totally different, it&amp;rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap. If your interested in it&amp;rsquo;s full history check out my build thread on D-Series.</description>

      <description>My Budget Build At my work, I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&amp;rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&amp;rsquo;s left me pretty happy.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we want code that can run outside of Unity And that can make things tricky when it comes to writing text to console. Unity has it&amp;rsquo;s own set of methods for writing to it&amp;rsquo;s command console via the Debug class with the most commonly used one being Debug.Log(). However in the event you want to create a library of code that can be run within Unity or in the command console (say a game server for example) you&amp;rsquo;ll need a way to differentiate between the running environments.</description>

      <description>Stepping back into Networking These past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a tangent that wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly planned. Diving head first into networking code, and attempting to refactor the voxel engine to support it really burnt me out. During this break I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the core voxel engine itself. I decided to take the time to really spruce up the voxel engine and add in some much needed features. While I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember every change some of the key ones are:</description>

      <title>Object Pooling in Unity</title>

      <description>GameObject.Instantiate() is Expensive Creating new gameobjects during runtime can be a costly operation. Multiple this action by 10 or more times in a single frame and you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a slight hiccup in FPS. One option to counter this is by taking advantage of object pooling. Object pooling is when a collection of inactive gameobjects is kept on standby. When the game needs a new object it can call upon the pool to retrieve an already instantiated instance.</description>

      <description>What is Greedy Meshing? Anyone who has spent some time working with voxels will have heard of the term &amp;lsquo;Greedy Meshing&amp;rsquo; at some point. If your new to the concept check out this article written by Mikola Lysenko. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the most popular (and if not best) article out there regarding voxel mesh generation.
However if your like me, your probably looking for a simpler explanation and perhaps some source code to really get the ball rolling, and improve your understanding.</description>

      <description>Welcome! If your reading this, it means you&amp;rsquo;ve found my new website. It&amp;rsquo;s still in it&amp;rsquo;s early stages so it may seem quite primitive. It&amp;rsquo;s powered via Hugo, and while I may have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JS, Go is a whole new concept.
In the following weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll work on dialing things in and at the same time post progresss about my various projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on.

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.
While it was kinda gross, it actually cleaned up pretty nicely. After a lot of scrubbing and cleaning it was finally ready for paint.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.
My first car was a 1999 Acura RL that I purchased from my Grandmother. The car was in rough shape, and needed some love but it was an amazing first car. I put over 36k miles on the car in 3 years, and loved everything about it.</description>
