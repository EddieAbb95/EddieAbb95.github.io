# EddieAbb95.github.io

Welcome! This repository hosts my personal blog / website. The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and is a perpetual work in progress. Here you'll find updates on my personal projects that vary from my project car (a totally rad 92 Civic) to my games. 

If your looking to contact me hit met up at: eddieabb95@gmail.com.
