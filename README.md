My personal blog where I post updates on various projects I'm working on. Posts will typically revolve around Unity and C# development, but other topics may arise here and there. My project car (a 1993 Civic yes I know...) will be brought up from time to time. I'm always doing something to it such as swapping the motor, shaving the engine bay and more, so it's fun to share progress.

The site itself is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which I'm learning as I go so occasionally things could be broken.
