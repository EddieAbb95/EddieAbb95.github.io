      <description>Delaying the Inevitable When it comes to my cars, I like to bunch up my repairs / mods into batches where I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on one small sub-category of tasks before moving onto the next.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain, but driving a car at night that has an auto dimming rear view mirror is a real treat. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that you&amp;rsquo;ll never notice when it&amp;rsquo;s working, but as soon as you don&amp;rsquo;t have it you&amp;rsquo;ll notice its absence immediately.</description>

      <description>Background I like to joke and say that anyone else would have sent my XJ to the junkyard.
Somedays if I&amp;rsquo;m in an especially sour mood from working on it, I&amp;rsquo;ll joke and say that anyone smart would have sent my XJ to the junkyard.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything major and wasn&amp;rsquo;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly been very lucky with my Jeep. My previous daily driver was a 2009 Subaru Legacy, and while it may have been excellent in the snow it had a very high cost of ownership.</description>

      <description>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.</description>

      <description>Repainting the Cherokee&amp;rsquo;s roof I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&amp;rsquo;t be beat.</description>
