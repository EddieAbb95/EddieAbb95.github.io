      <description>In the past ~12 months there&#39;s only been about a couple weeks where I didn&#39;t have some kind of side project I was working on. I&#39;m just a very hands on person who loves working on projects and code feels like the perfect medium. Best of all it&#39;s almost free to produce and when you mess up you&#39;re not out a lot of money vs other hobbies like woodworking.
But code has been more than a hobby for me.</description>
