  <span class="post-date">Published Feb 1, 2019</span>
  <p>Coming from the .NET world String.Format() was by far my most used function for generating user readable error / log messages. After jumping over to TypeScript, I was bummed to learn that no similar function existed. However, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad, after all console.log() allows us to pass multiple parameters and has no trouble logging them.
let foo = { bar: 1 }; console.log('Foo is ', foo); //Prints: Foo is Object { bar : 1 }  But this only covers one of the many use cases I used String.</p>

  <p>Intro Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) powers the web. It&rsquo;s the silent work horse used to carry data between servers and clients, and is the reason why all URLs start with HTTP, or HTTPS. For those new to HTTP, it can be though of as clients (users) making requests that are sent to servers which then reply back with responses. Only servers can make responses, and only clients can make requests.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve honestly been very lucky with my Jeep. My previous daily driver was a 2009 Subaru Legacy, and while it may have been excellent in the snow it had a very high cost of ownership. I figured out that it was costing me on average $100 in maintenance per 1000 miles travelled. It may sound silly to have sold the Subaru and bought a Jeep that was 9 years older but I have zero regrets doing so.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jan 24, 2019</span>
  <p>What Are They? HTTP cookies are small bits of text that are included with each HTTP request made from a user&rsquo;s web browser to web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means each requests is treated as a unique command, and no state data is maintained. Cookies were designed to fill this gap, and allow servers to associate data with user&rsquo;s as they traverse sites. Cookies are commonly used by sites to hold authentication tokens, tracking ids, or save user preferences.</p>

  <p>Intro If you were expecting a phone call from a friend, you (hopefully) wouldn&rsquo;t sit by the phone and continuously pick it up to see if your friend was on the other end. Instead, you&rsquo;d wait to be notified of an incoming call when the phone started ringing or vibrating. Sitting by the phone and picking it up over and over again is a form of what&rsquo;s known as polling.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jan 5, 2019</span>
  <p>What&rsquo;s so Magical About Magic Strings? Magic strings are string literals strewn about a code base that apply some kind of limitation to the code. They can be used to filter valid input, constrain parameters, or control the behavior of code.
They are often considered an anti-pattern due to how to they introduce the potential for bugs when typos occur, or by the difficulty they create when the need to change a magic string occurs.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Dec 21, 2018</span>
  <p>Overview This is the second part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Dec 7, 2018</span>
  <p>Admit it, we&rsquo;ve all written bad code at some point in our software development careers. One could even argue it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to write bad code when the situation calls for it. Bad code is perfect for cranking out minimum viable products, or implementing a last minute fix for a critical bug in production that has management breathing down the back of your neck waiting for a solution.
The catch-22 however, is that bad code should only be brought to life when it will have a life-span so short that death is already looming in the shadows waiting to snatch it.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Nov 26, 2018</span>
  <p>Summary For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&rsquo;s &ldquo;JavaScript that scales&rdquo;, and once you use it you&rsquo;ll never go back. But finding a decent tutorial on how to set up a new TypeScript project is quite the challenge. Many tutorials are out-dated and want you to install other packages such as gulp, jump through hoops, or even sacrifice your first born child (okay maybe not but still).</p>

  <p>The Less You Know, The Better Do you think the automotive designers who carefully crafted each body line and roll of your car&rsquo;s chassis cared about the engine&rsquo;s cylinder bore or stroke? Or perhaps the firing order, or whether the engine had 2 spark plugs per cylinder akin to Chrysler&rsquo;s hemis?
Of course not, all they cared about were the more important details such as dimensions, mounting positions, electrical connections, and plumbing points.</p>
