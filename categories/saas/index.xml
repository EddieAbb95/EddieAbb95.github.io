      <description>Overview This is the second part of my blog series about launching a Software as a Service (SaaS) product. I intend for this series to be a collection of the lessons I&#39;ve learnt along the way, and is meant to be an educational experience. Because learning new things is one of my motivations there will be times where I explore DIYing portions of the project that should typically be offloaded to a third-party.</description>
