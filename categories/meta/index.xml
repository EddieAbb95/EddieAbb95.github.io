      <description>My Budget Build At my work, I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&amp;rsquo;m on a college student budget, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&amp;rsquo;s left me pretty happy.</description>

      <description>Welcome! If your reading this, it means you&amp;rsquo;ve found my new website. It&amp;rsquo;s still in it&amp;rsquo;s early stages so it may seem quite primitive. It&amp;rsquo;s powered via Hugo, and while I may have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JS, Go is a whole new concept.
In the following weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll work on dialing things in and at the same time post progresss about my various projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
What is this blog about?</description>
