      <description>Passenger side rocker replacement This post is the second part in my mini-series of restoring my old xj cherokee. If your interested, check out my attempt at saving the rusty roof.
Like most xjs out there, especially those in the rustier parts of the US, the rocker panels needed some love. I never really captured a good before shot of the rust on the passenger side rocker. It was roughly 9&amp;rdquo; in length and about 3&amp;rdquo; wide.</description>

      <description>Repainting the Cherokee&amp;rsquo;s roof I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&amp;rsquo;t be beat. Since my civic is far from snow worthy I also own a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. It may not be the prettiest vehicle out there but it&amp;rsquo;s never let me down, and has successfully travelled 20,000 miles in it&amp;rsquo;s first year of owner ship with a couple road trips ranging in the 800-1000 mile range.</description>
